          useCallback is a React hook that allows you to memoize a function.
          This means that the function will only be recreated if one of its
          dependencies has changed. This can be useful for optimizing
          performance in React components that have expensive calculations or
          operations that are triggered by React events.

        <br />
        <p>Here is an example of how useCallback can be used:</p>
        <img src={callbackImage} alt="useCallback-img" />
        <p>
          In the code above, the handleClick function is defined using the
          useCallback hook. The second argument to useCallback is an array of
          dependencies, which specifies the values that the callback function
          depends on. In this case, the handleClick function depends on the data
          prop.
          <br />
          The handleClick function will only be recreated if the data prop
          changes. This means that if the MyComponent component is re-rendered
          with the same data prop, the handleClick function will be the same
          reference as before and will not be recreated. This can help avoid
          unnecessary calculations or operations and improve the performance of
          the component.
          <br />
          When using useCallback, it is important to make sure that the
          dependencies array is correct and up to date. If the dependencies
          array is missing a value that the callback function actually depends
          on, the function will not be recreated when it should, which can cause
          bugs. On the other hand, if the dependencies array includes a value
          that the callback function does not actually depend on, the function
          will be recreated unnecessarily, which can also cause performance
          issues.
